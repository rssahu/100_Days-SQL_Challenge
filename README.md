DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Transactions;

CREATE TABLE Transactions
(transaction_id int, day timestamp, amount int);

insert into Transactions (transaction_id, day, amount) 
values 
('8', '2021-4-3 15:57:28', '57'),
('9', '2021-4-28 08:47:25', '21'),
('1', '2021-4-29 13:28:30', '58'),

('6', '2021-4-29 23:39:28', '58'),
('10', '2021-4-3 16:57:28', '57');

SELECT * FROM transactions;


-- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the transactions
-- with the maximum amount on their respective day. 

-- If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.

SELECT 
	transaction_id
FROM
	(SELECT 
		*,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY 
		(EXTRACT(DAY FROM day) ) 
		ORDER BY amount DESC)
		as ranks
	FROM transactions
	) as x
WHERE ranks = 1
